So this will be the first slightly extended blog entry that might survive the real thing. 

What do I want from this blog?
- Build a reference point for important concepts I have learnt
- Give myself an outlet to talk through things I am finding difficult
- Log questions
- Talk about my general experience of learning to code and building my tech skills

I like a good structure so ideally, I want to build a visually cool 2*2 which covers a daily summary of
- What learnt?
- What was challenging?
- What can I change?
- What else?

For today I am mainly just excited that I have stuck to trying to figure out these blogging templates and have found a very slick one that I will start building out on the side and transfer over too.
